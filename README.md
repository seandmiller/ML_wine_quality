# ML Red Wine Quality

## Features Map.

## fixed acidity:

Influences the flavor of the wine. A significant reduction in acids can lead to wines that taste flat. Examples of fixed acids are tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic, which can be found in grapes (except succinic). It is measured in g/dm3.

## volatile acidity:

These acids must be distilled out from the wine before the end of the production process. Excess of volatile acids are undesirable and lead to unpleasant flavor. It is measured in g/dm3. citric acid: The amount of citric acid in the wine, which most of it is usually consumed during the fermentation process. It acts as a preservative and small quantities can add freshness and flavor. It is measured in g/dm3.

## residual sugar:

The amount of sugar remaining after the end of the fermentation. The goal is to have a perfect balance between sweetness and sourness. Wines with more than 45g/dm3 are considered sweet. It is measured in g/dm3.

## chlorides:

The amount of salt in the wine.

## free sulfur dioxide:

The amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in free form. They are also known as sulfites and too much of it is undesirable and gives a pungent odour. It is measured in g/dm3.

## total sulfur dioxide:

The total amount of SO2 in the wine. This is added to kill harmful bacteria and preserve quality and freshness. It is measured in mg/dm3.

## density:

It is used as a measure of the conversion of sugar to alcohol. Sweeter wines have higher density.

## pH:

Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic).

## sulphates:

The amount of mineral salts containing sulfur in the wine. It is an additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. They are related to the fermentation process and affect the aroma and flavor of the wine.

## alcohol:

Alcohol is formed as a result of yeast converting sugar during the fermentation process. It's usually measured in % volume or alcohol by volume (ABV).

## quality:

A quality label in the range of 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). It is the median of at least three evaluations made by wine experts.

## Instructions

Very simple, first create a virtual enviroment and to run the Neural Network model simple run the command "python3 nn.py" to run the random forest algorithm the command is 'python3 rf.py' the output will be printed out in the terminal. This is simply a test to see the behaviors of different models.
You can also load saved models and predict from external data using 'python3 load_nn.py' and 'python3 load_rf.py'
